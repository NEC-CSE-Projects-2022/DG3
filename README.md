## Abstract

This project focuses on predicting train delays using deep learning techniques applied to operational and environmental railway data. The dataset includes features such as station-to-station distance, weather conditions, day of the week, time slots, train type, congestion levels, and historical delays. Four deep learning models—DNN, CNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM—were implemented and compared under uniform experimental conditions. The models were evaluated using RMSE, MAE, R², and sMAPE metrics. Experimental results show that the BiLSTM model achieved the highest accuracy, effectively capturing bidirectional temporal dependencies in delay sequences. The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential for real-time railway delay forecasting and intelligent transportation system integration.
